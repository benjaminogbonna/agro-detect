    <h5>Cercospora Leaf Spot of Cowpea</h5>
    <p>
      <b>Symptoms</b>
      <ul>
        <li>First symptoms are leaves having inconspicuous spots, reddish-brown- up to15mm diameter, not restricted by veins.</li>
        <li>Leaf spots merge as leaves go yellow and die.</li>
        <li>Dead areas on the leaf may fall out giving a shot-hole appearance.</li>
        <li>The disease flourishes on older leaves.</li>
        <li>The disease is caused by the fungus, Mycosphaerella cruenta</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Prevention</b>
      <ol>
        <li>Use less susceptible cowpea varieties (e.g. slipea 1, 2 and 3; VRB-10)</li>
        <li>Use clean seed; either obtain the seed from a reliable seed supplier or clean the seed of plant debris.</li>
        <li>Plant new crop seed and not from older ones with disease.</li>
        <li>Use healthy, and disease-free seeds</li>
        <li>Use correct planting density (wider spacing such as 50 cm x 30 cm or 50 cm x 40 cm)</li>
        <li>Intercrop cowpea with maize or sorghum in order to reduce spread of the disease</li>
        <li>Remove alternative host plants (e.g. Ageratum conyzoides)</li>
        <li>Remove volunteer plants of cowpea and other legumes before field planting.</li>
        <li>Remove weeds at 3 and 6 weeks after planting</li>
        <li>Plough and harrow to destroy fungal inoculum in the soil</li>
        <li>Plough under crop residues</li>
        <li>Crop rotation (cowpea + maize)</li>
        <li>Destroy diseased debris</li>
        <li>Avoiding excessive irrigation is recommended</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Direct control</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove diseased plants and burn outside the crop field, burn or bury the trash after harvest.</li>
        <li>Remove heavily infected plants to prevent spread of inoculum</li>
        <li>Early pruning of infected leaves to prevent further spread of inoculum</li>
        <li>Spray aqueous leaf extracts from neem and pepper (leaf powder: 100 g/ litres water). Apply early in the morning or late in the evening; Do not apply when it is raining or windy; Use protective gears to avoid being poisoned.</li>
        <li>Seed treatment with Mancozeb (ethylene Bisdithiocarbamate): 80g a.i/kg of seeds.</li>
        <li>Foliage treatment with Mancozeb fungicide: 100 ml/14 L of water. This should be applied after the crop has flowered and pods are starting to develop, with a maximum of 2-3 applications per planting season, though its cost-effectiveness is doubtful.</li>
        <li>Apply Cupric oxide (Copper oxide) on cowpea foliage</li>
      </ul>
