    <h5>Phosphorus Deficiency in Maize</h5>
    <p>
      <b>Symptoms</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Young plant look dwarfed and thin with dark green leaves.</li>
        <li>It may also manifest by reddish discoloration at juvenile stages of growth</li>
        <li>Leaf margins veins and stems show purple tints which may spread over the whole leaf blade</li>
        <li>The disease is caused by phosphorus deficiency in the farm soil.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Prevention</b>
      <ol>
        <li>Apply manure e.g. well decomposed compost manure made from plants.
          Apply 12.5 tonnes/Ha at least five weeks before planting maize.
          This can be achieved by applying an equivalent of 20 L tin of manure (16-18 Kg)
          by broadcasting every 8 metres/steps. If manure is not adequate,
          apply 2 handfuls (0.5-1.5 kg) per planting station and mix with the soil before planting
        </li>

        <li>Apply inorganic fertilizers such as 23:10:5+6S+1.0Zn at the rate of 100 kg/Ha
          using a bottle top of a 300 ml glass Fanta bottle with lining inside at 10
          cm away from the planting station and 10 cm deep with planting stations spaced
          at 25 cm apart (one-one planting pattern)
        </li>

        <li>Neutralize acidic soils, adequate drainage of crop fields, reduce high iron
          content in the soil
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
